The film was converted to 3D by Maya Digital Studios, and was released on January 3, 2014. The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who praised the original film's story, performances and music, but criticized the 3D conversion quality and the editing changes. The film was also dubbed in Hindi and English languages, and was available in 1080p resolution for high-definition viewing.
 
Sholay 3D is a rare example of an Indian film that has been re-released in 3D format, and is a tribute to the classic film that has influenced generations of Indian cinema lovers. The film is a must-watch for fans of Sholay, who can relive the iconic scenes and dialogues in a new dimension. The film is also a good introduction for new viewers, who can experience the thrill and drama of one of the best Indian films of all time.
  
The original film Sholay was released in 1975, and was a blockbuster hit that broke many box-office records. The film was written by the famous duo Salim-Javed, who created memorable characters and dialogues that became part of the Indian pop culture. The film was also known for its innovative use of sound effects, cinematography and editing, which enhanced the action and suspense sequences. The film's soundtrack, composed by R.D. Burman, featured songs that ranged from romantic to comic to tragic, and were sung by legendary singers like Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and Manna Dey.
 
The 3D version of Sholay was released in 2014, after a long and difficult process of conversion. The film's producer G.P. Sippy had initially planned to release the film in 3D in 2009, but faced legal issues with his son Sascha Sippy, who claimed the rights to the film. The matter was resolved in 2012, and the conversion work began in 2013. The film's original negatives were scanned and restored, and the 3D effects were added using computer graphics. The film's length was also reduced by 15 minutes, and some scenes were re-edited or removed to suit the 3D format.
 
The film's release was met with mixed reactions from critics and audiences. Some praised the film for its nostalgia value and its timeless appeal, while others criticized the film for its poor 3D quality and its unnecessary changes. The film also faced competition from other Bollywood releases like Dhoom 3 and Dedh Ishqiya, which affected its box-office performance. The film earned about Rs. 50 crore in India, and Rs. 10 crore overseas, making it a moderate success. The film also received several awards and nominations, including the National Film Award for Best Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment.
